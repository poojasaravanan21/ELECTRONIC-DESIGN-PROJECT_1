## Module 2: Anti-Sleep Alarm Glasses

### Abstract
Driver fatigue is a major cause of road accidents worldwide, often resulting from prolonged driving and lack of rest. The **Anti-Sleep Alarm Glasses** aim to address this critical issue by using sensors and algorithms to detect early signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eyelid closures or head tilting. Upon detection, they activate an auditory or vibrational alarm to alert the user and prevent accidents. Designed for comfort, these glasses are ideal for long-distance drivers and night shift workers. This innovation improves road safety, reduces accidents, and showcases potential for future advancements in fatigue detection technology.

### Introduction
The **Anti-Sleep Alarm Glasses** are an innovative wearable device designed to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness, particularly among drivers and individuals engaged in critical tasks. Equipped with infrared (IR) sensors, the glasses monitor the user's eye movements to detect early signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eyelid closure or reduced blinking rates. When drowsiness is detected, the device triggers an immediate alert via a buzzer or vibration, effectively waking the user and preventing potential mishaps. The compact, lightweight design ensures comfort during prolonged use, making it suitable for drivers, machine operators, and other professionals prone to fatigue. This project combines real-time monitoring with sensor technology to address a significant safety issue, promoting safer practices in various fields.
